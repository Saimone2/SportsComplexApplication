# SportsComplexApplication
Spring Boot application that contains web pages for managing customer registration and displaying a list of registered customers. Also, on the basis of clients, you can register club cards and enable the visiting mode and the services used.

The website is built on the Spring MVC framework. The Spring JPA module was used to connect to the MySQL database. Tomcat was used for the servlet containers and the local server. The application uses the Thymeleaf server-side Java templating engine, which enables dynamic content and data binding.

There is a form for adding a new field on the customer or club card page. There are also links to edit and delete information about each customer or card. So there is a separate page for editing the created user. A complete CRUD system has been created. Spring Validation of fields with messages that will be displayed if there are errors in any of the form fields is also used.
